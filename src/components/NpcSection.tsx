        The concept of non-playable characters was brought into the world
        through DnD in the 70s, and in many ways does a great job being in
        parallel to real life. Whoever is reading this is an NPC in my world, as
        I am one in yours. Scoped in each of our individual worlds, essentially
        everyone besides ourselves is an NPC. Popularized through video games,
        notably at least for me Skyrim, this concept of pressing X to interact
        is far from constrained to video games. Especially in the social-media
        driven world of everything being almost “official”, where interactions
        revolve around follows, likes, comments, ratios, DMs, and simply who
        even is on the platforms in the first place, this literal “pressing X”
        shapes how we socialize.

      <p>
        An effort I’ve been making, being engrossed in the San Francisco tech
        bubble, is one to metaphorically “press X” with people that I would
        normally not interact with through these predetermined means. A few key
        NPC interactions with a Japanese Grandma in Tokyo, an Unc in New York
        City, and Sullen Phillips, a homeless man in San Francisco, have shaped
        me and my perspective on life.

        Japanese Grandma
      </h2>

      <p>
        I visited Japan, as many freshly minted Computer Science majors do, in
        April of 2024. Arriving a few days earlier than my friends, I found time
        to walk around, explore, and try experiences I enjoy doing alone. On the
        day my friends were arriving I was bored, out of things to explore, and
        so as I do, picked a spot on the map and showed up there. Quiet and
        residential, there weren’t many attractions to see. I found a quaint
        park in which some kids were running around. There were about fifty
        preschoolers running around this park, each wearing a floppy hat colored
        one of four choices, what I figured to be different classes. I sat down
        with my coffee and was soon approached by an elderly lady, whom I’d
        guess to be around eighty to ninety years of age.
      </p>

      <p>
        She started talking to me, only for both of us to very quickly realize
        that I spoke zero Japanese, nor her English. I whipped out Google
        Translate, trying to find some common ground of communication that we
        could share, but she quickly pushed my hand away indicating her dislike
        for the phone. With nothing else to do, we shared what passed as
        conversation for around an hour and a half. With virtually zero shared
        vocabulary and a healthy amount of comfortable silences, we shared time
        together. She did however have an arsenal of about ten phrases in
        English where we could somewhat understand. I learned she had sisters,
        lived in France, could speak French, and grew up in the area. She also
        loved reciting nursery rhymes: “Row, row, row your boat,” and “Po, po,
        po, hato po, po,” which she would sing over and over.
      </p>

      <p>
        We almost understood each other completely, despite having a
        single-digit shared vocabulary. It was an incredibly human interaction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="underline text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">Unc</h2>

      <p>
        After graduating, before starting my first job out of college, I went to
        NYC in July 2024 to visit my brother and friends living in the city. I
        flew in on a Wednesday morning, and as everyone had work and
        responsibilities, I was alone for the day. Bored, I started wandering.
        At Washington Square Park, I played chess with a man raising money for
        autism, grabbed some of the TikTok-viral Pop Up Bagels, and sat down on
        a bench. I noticed a fifty-something, big-bodied man relaxing nearby. I
        “pressed X” and we started talking.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had just gotten a blood test and was relaxing in the park. He’d grown
        up in Harlem and been there his entire life, so I asked how I should
        spend this day in the city. He quickly responded, “Let’s go right now.”
        Thinking why not, we headed to the nearest subway station. Gleaming with
        pride, he showed me around his city—explaining subway rules of thumb,
        little tricks, and the city in an organic manner. We rode from 14th to
        51st, where he walked me through Times Square, describing its
        rambunctious past, then strolled Central Park and peeked into the zoo,
        which he’d never visited. He shared stories about his life, growing up
        in the city, and the changes he’d witnessed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We spent a good portion of the day together before parting ways. I loved
        seeing the passion he held for his hometown.
      </p>

      <h2 className="underline text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">
        Sullen Phillips
      </h2>

      <p>
        Golden Gate Park is one of the most stunning parts of San Francisco, and
        one Sunday in March 2025 I was wandering there. On my way out, I exited
        on the Richmond side toward a bus stop and saw a homeless man, Sullen
        Phillips. He was well-built, tall, muscular, and asking for money. I
        only had a $10 bill, so I handed it to him and walked on, earbuds in. I
        sat down and saw him and his partner smoking nearby. Honestly, I was
        okay if he spent my money on a cigarette, but he looked me in the eye
        and insisted it wasn’t with the money I gave him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Minutes later I got curious and “pressed X.” I approached him and asked
        about his story. He was an Army veteran who’d served two tours, survived
        gunshots—showing me the bullet holes and the scar on his leg where it
        almost cost him his limb. He can’t sleep without night terrors and uses
        alcohol to knock himself out. I thanked him for his service and asked
        for his name. He replied, “Sullen Phillips.”
      </p>

      <p>
        We shared the same bus ride downtown as he and his partner slept on
        Treasure Island. He told me how a series of decisions led him here, how
        moving from Texas to California backfired against a rising cost of
        living, and how the VA covered his bills but didn’t compensate him
        fairly. He’d lost jobs due to injury and mental health struggles.
      </p>

      <p>
        I asked about his day-to-day life. Every day, it’s a struggle deciding
        between food, clean clothing, and shelter—rarely are all three
        guaranteed. He makes about $13 a day split between him and his wife. He
        explained how he must be territorial to survive and how losing
        pride—from war hero to panhandling—affects one’s spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sullen Phillips spoke passionately about mental health solutions. He
        said the city spends more on safe drug-use policies than addressing
        homelessness. He described how chronic pain and trauma drive people
        toward hard drugs, and how many homeless drift into severe mental
        illness. He contrasted those lucid veterans like himself with others
        whose struggles make them almost unrecognizable.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of our ride, I asked his name again. “Sullen Phillips,” he
        said. A person’s name is the one thing they truly own, and I wanted to
        say his with pride.
