        I live near Bernal Heights, and it’s easily my favorite place in the
        city. Started from randomly trying to explore the area around me,
        Bernal—Bernie as I call it affectionately—has become a weekly ritual.
      </p>

      <p>
        From taking a walk, to getting my cardio in, to enjoying a little Smokey
        treat, Bernie helps me process, think, and just relax with awesome views
        of the greatest city on Earth, San Francisco. That’s an argument I’ll
        die on a hill for (haha, get it).
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of my walk, I always sit on a certain bench, and it has this
        quote: “Sit. Relax. Enjoy my favorite view.”
